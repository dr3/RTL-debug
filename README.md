# Issue

When using `npm link` to link a dependancy that uses `react-testing-library` it doesnt return the css generated by styled components.

# What is this repo?

This repo shows the bug, it has 2 examples, 

- psammead-headings which links to psammead-test-helpers (which uses `react-testing-library`),

- psammead-headings-with-test-helpers which has `react-testing-library` as a dependancy directly


When `psammead-headings` is locally linked to `psammead-test-helpers`, `react-testing-library` produces a fragment without styles, vs when `psammead-headings-with-test-helpers` uses `react-testing-library` which does have styles.


# To Replicate issue


```
npm install
```

```
cd packages/psammead-headings && npm link ../psammead-test-helpers && cd ..;
```

```
npm run build && npm run test -- -u
```
